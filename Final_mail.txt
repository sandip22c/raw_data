As some of you may know, today is my last working day at Company.

It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every moment and I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with each of you.

 

I am very thankful to all my managers, the team members & the colleagues here for the cooperation and support extended to me during my time here.

And a very Big "Thank You" to all my friends with whom I have spent the wonderful moments, that would last a lifetime.

Even though I will miss you all, I am looking forward to this new challenge and to start a new phase in my career.

I wish you all success in your personal as well as your professional career.

 

We live in a small world so I am sure some of our paths may cross again. Below is my personal contact details so letâ€™s try and keep in touch.
